# Taboom

This is a game for Android devices where you have to make your mates guess the word without using a list of forbidden words.
Include a customizable timer and a scoreboard. Some words are already included but you can add all your personal words and add some tags in order to play only with the words you choose. You can save you words is a file in the device and send them to your friends if you want.
Available only in Italian, my mother tongue.
